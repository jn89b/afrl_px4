/**
 * @file server.h
 *
 * The server (also called daemon) opens a pipe for clients to write to.
 *
 * Once a client connects it will send a command as well as a unique ID.
 * The server will return the stdout of the executing command, as well as the return
 * value to the client on a client specific pipe.
 * The client specific pipe are idenified by the unique ID of the client.
 *
 * There should only every be one server running, therefore the static instance.
 * The Singleton implementation is not complete, but it should be obvious not
 * to instantiate multiple servers.
